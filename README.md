# signalr-client-nodejs
This is a signalR client for node.js. 

The only communication channel that is supported is websockets.  This will not 
fallback to long polling or any other protocol. 

Make sure your hub is configured to support websockets.

This is a node.js service client.  It is not supported within a web browser.  
For browser support use the offical client from Microsoft.

* [signalr-client on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalr-client)

## I'm looking for contributors

I am not actively working on a project using this library… as such I don’t really 
have the time to maintain this code base.  If anyone would like to help contribute
to this project please feel free to contact me.
